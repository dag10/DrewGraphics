# Drew's OpenGL Experiments

This is a monolithic repository of all of my little experimental OpenGL projects
as I teach myself OpenGL.

It's broken down into sub projects:

| Project                    | Description                                                                    |
| :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [ImageFader](./ImageFader) | A GLEW+GLUT Xcode project that has floating quads fading between two textures. |
| [HelloGlfw](./HelloGlfw)   | A redo as I learn to use GLFW instead of GLEW+GLUT.                            |
